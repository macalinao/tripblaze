Trip-Maker
=========
Itâ€™s a travel website for planning your itinerary. By answering a small survey it will also be able to recommend places based on your preferences as well as the top rated places on TripAdvisor.

Survey
--------
After taking the survey we use a list of commands from the Sabre Api to meet the needs of the user to find the cheapest and best flight according to the users needs

In the survey, the user sets the departuredate. If departuredate is present and has a value, use departuredate and returndate. Ignore lengthofstay, earliestdeparturedate, and latestdeparturedate.
We also use the origin, departuredate, and returndate parameter (provided from the survey). The origin parameter is required in all request formats.  (String)
We also have another parameter for the location, (Also a string) which is provided from the survey and used to find the best flight.

What we can find out from the information
